# Road Accident Data Analysis

## Problem Statement
Road traffic accidents are a major public safety concern, resulting in significant loss of life, injuries, and economic costs. Despite various safety measures, the frequency and severity of accidents remain high in many regions.  

To effectively reduce accidents and improve road safety, it is crucial to understand the **patterns**, **causes**, and **risk factors** associated with road accidents.

## Project Objective
This project aims to analyze the **`Road Accident Data.xlsx`** dataset to:

- **Identify** key factors contributing to road accidents (such as time, weather, road type, vehicle type, and light conditions).  
- **Discover** trends and patterns in accident occurrence and severity.  
- **Provide** actionable insights and recommendations for policymakers and stakeholders to enhance road safety and reduce accident rates.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** (Data Cleaning, Analysis, and Visualization)
  - `pandas` – Data manipulation and preprocessing
  - `numpy` – Numerical computations
  - `matplotlib` – Static visualizations
  - `seaborn` – Statistical visualizations
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard creation and insights presentation

## Expected Outcomes
- Data-driven understanding of accident patterns.
- Evidence-based recommendations for accident prevention.
- Improved road safety awareness through insights visualization.
